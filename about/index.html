          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            I work on machine learning systems that need to run reliably in production environments. 
            My projects cover the full ML lifecycle: ingesting and validating data, engineering features, 
            training and evaluating models, packaging artefacts, deploying inference endpoints, and 
            implementing monitoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            For language model applications, I implement retrieval-augmented generation patterns with 
            source citations, guardrails, and evaluation frameworks. The focus is on building systems 
            that can be tested, debugged, and maintained.

          <h3>Technical Approach</h3>
          <p>
            I prioritise reproducibility through containerisation, versioned datasets, and fixed random seeds. 
            Models are evaluated using relevant metrics (precision, recall, MAE, MAPE) and compared against 
            baselines. Deployment includes health checks, logging, and drift monitoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            The projects on this site demonstrate working systems rather than proof-of-concept notebooks. 
            Each includes documentation of architecture decisions, technology choices, and trade-offs.

          <h3>Technical Stack</h3>
          <p>
            Python for ML pipelines and model development. FastAPI for inference serving. 
            Docker for containerisation. MLflow for experiment tracking. Prometheus and Grafana 
            for monitoring. GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
          </p>
          <p>
            For LLM applications: retrieval with vector databases, prompt orchestration, 
            and evaluation harnesses. When appropriate, I use established libraries 
            rather than building custom solutions.
